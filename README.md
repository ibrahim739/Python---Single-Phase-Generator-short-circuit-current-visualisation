# Python---Single-Phase-Generator-short-circuit-current-visualisation
Python script which purpose is to calculate and visualize the Total short circuit current of a single phase generator.
The total fault current also known as the Asymmetrical fault current is composed of two components: The Ac fault current also named as symmetrical current or steady-state fault current + the dc offset current which decays exponentially with time constant taw.
In this script, we assume Maximum Dc offset which represents the worst case.

If you got the Generator parameters which includes the Voltage, Internal inductance and resistance and the working frequency, this script will do the short circuit calculation for you and visualize all the short circuit current components ( Instantaneous total short circuit current variation over time, Instantaneous short circuit current Rms variation, Rms AC short circuit current component and the DC short circuit current component )
